# Module: Spiritual Disciplines Practice

## Purpose

The **Spiritual Disciplines Practice** module directly assesses the user’s engagement with key Christian disciplines that form the foundation of spiritual maturity, intimacy with God, and long-term faithfulness. These disciplines are not merely habits but **transformational practices** that shape the soul and open the spirit to God's work.

This module helps uncover how consistently and authentically users integrate both **personal and communal spiritual rhythms**, as well as the **heart posture** behind their practices.
