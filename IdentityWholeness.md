# Module: Identity Wholeness Score

## Purpose

The Identity Wholeness Score is an **inferred composite metric** designed to reflect a user’s core sense of self, resilience, and integration of past wounds with present truth. It helps surface whether the user operates from their **God-given identity** or from an adaptive/false self shaped by trauma, fear, or societal expectation.

It is not a directly assessed module. Instead, it draws input from multiple assessed modules to estimate a person’s **identity cohesion, authenticity, and narrative integrity.**

## Inputs (Inferred From Assessed Modules)

* **Sanctification & Spiritual Growth**: maturity, spiritual rootedness, fruit of the Spirit.
* **Healing History & Inner Vows**: resolution of shame, self-perception, false identity patterns.
* **Relationship & Attachment Style**: emotional congruence, boundary clarity, secure base.
* **Calling Readiness** *(inferred)*: conviction, value consistency, non-performance identity.
* **Trauma Recovery & Somatic Awareness**: ability to differentiate true self from adaptive self.

## Realigned Question Mapping (From Other Modules)

These identity-based insights are gathered from other modules, where the questions are assessed:

| Statement                                                                | Assessed Module                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| “I feel like I know who I truly am even when circumstances change.”      | Sanctification & Spiritual Growth      |
| “I can speak honestly about my failures without shame.”                  | Healing History & Restoration Pathways |
| “My values stay consistent regardless of the group I’m with.”            | Sanctification & Spiritual Growth      |
| “I no longer feel the need to pretend or prove myself to others.”        | Trauma Recovery / Inner Vows           |
| “I feel like the same person whether I’m alone or in public.”            | Relationship & Attachment Style        |
| “I know the difference between my true self and my trauma-adapted self.” | Trauma Recovery / Healing History      |

## Composite Scoring Logic

The Identity Wholeness Score uses a **weighted composite system**, balancing the following dimensions:

* ✅ Authenticity & Non-Performance Identity (Calling + Attachment)
* ✅ Shame Resolution & Emotional Transparency (Healing + Relationship)
* ✅ Consistent Moral Compass & Conviction (Sanctification + Heart Burden)
* ✅ Differentiation of True vs. False Self (Healing + Somatic Awareness)
* ✅ Resilience & Continuity Under Pressure (Sanctification + Timeline)

**Scoring Tiers:**

* **Integrated (80–100%)**: High authenticity, spiritual and emotional coherence, healthy vulnerability.
* **Emerging (60–79%)**: Progressing in self-understanding, with some areas of masking or disconnection.
* **Fragmented (0–59%)**: Significant masking, unresolved wounds, or identity defined by external factors.

## Insights Generated

* 💡 Narrative summary of the user’s identity development journey.
* 🪞 Highlighted themes of growth, stability, and integration.
* ⚠️ Identity cautions such as perfectionism, codependency, or shape-shifting for approval.
* 📖 Scriptural encouragements around identity (e.g., Psalm 139, Ephesians 1, Romans 8).
* 🛠️ Suggestions for healing, spiritual anchoring, and living from the true self.
