# Module: Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

## Purpose

The **Emotional Intelligence (EQ)** module reflects a user's emotional awareness, empathy, social regulation, and relational decision-making. While it can optionally be input as a known EQ score from an external source, PsycheGenesis also infers EQ from related behavioral modules.

This score plays a critical role in evaluating the user‚Äôs **leadership readiness, relational health, and growth potential**, especially in pastoral, mentoring, or emotionally demanding roles.

## Input Methods

* **Manual Input (Optional)**: Users may enter a known EQ score from an external test (e.g., EQ-i 2.0, MSCEIT).
* **Inferred Composite**: Synthesized from data across multiple modules:

  * Conflict Resolution Style
  * Relationship & Attachment Style
  * Somatic Awareness
  * Trauma & Inner Vow Recovery
  * Sanctification & Growth
  * Healing History
  * Vocational Clarity & Role Execution Patterns

## Composite Dimensions

Inferred EQ scoring includes:

* **Self-Awareness** ‚Äì Recognizing internal emotions and patterns
* **Self-Regulation** ‚Äì Managing stress, impulses, and difficult emotions
* **Social Awareness** ‚Äì Empathic accuracy, understanding others' perspectives
* **Relational Skills** ‚Äì Navigating social dynamics and resolving conflicts constructively
* **Spiritual-Emotional Integration** ‚Äì Applying biblical principles to emotional growth

## Composite Scoring Tiers

* **High EQ (80‚Äì100%)**: Strong relational presence, emotionally resilient, well-regulated
* **Developing EQ (60‚Äì79%)**: Growing self-awareness with some reactive tendencies
* **Low EQ (0‚Äì59%)**: Struggles with empathy, emotional reactivity, or social conflict
