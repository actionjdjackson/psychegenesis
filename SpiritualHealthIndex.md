# Module: Spiritual Health Index (Inferred)

## Purpose

To provide a snapshot-style, cross-dimensional indicator of the user’s overall spiritual well-being, vitality, and alignment with biblical rhythms of life. The Spiritual Health Index is like a real-time pulse check on the soul’s nourishment, alertness, and submission to the Holy Spirit, derived from multiple other inputs across the PsycheGenesis system.

## Areas Profiled

* Timeline Recency of Key Events (e.g. recent revival, baptism, repentance, guidance received)
* Frequency and Impact of Healing Milestones
* Emotional Regulation Scores
* Relationship and Attachment Style Health
* Fruit of the Spirit Development (inferred from growth, relational, and trauma/healing metrics)
* Somatic Awareness and Restorative Rhythms
* Worship, Prayer, and Discipleship-Related Timeline Entries

## Question Structure

*Inferred module — no dedicated question set.* Derived from:

* Response patterns across sanctification, healing, and somatic/emotional modules
* Recency of spiritual activity and timeline confirmations
* Balance between output (ministry, calling) and input (nourishment, rest, worship)

## Output

* Indexed Score: **"Low," "Developing," "Moderate," "Strong," or "Flourishing"**
* Highlighted Deficiencies: e.g. emotional fatigue, spiritual dryness, disconnection from community, lack of input rhythms
* Strength Indicators: e.g. consistent prayer life, healing integration, spiritual renewal markers
* Recommendations: re-engage in spiritual disciplines, seek prayer/ministry, prioritize spiritual rest, etc.

## Insights Generated

* "You are flourishing in many areas of spiritual vitality, especially in relational depth and prophetic awareness, though your rest rhythms may be lagging."
* "Your score suggests a developing stage, with recent healing breakthroughs but signs of spiritual fatigue. Now is a good time to rest and be poured into."
* "Low input rhythms and a long gap since your last major milestone suggest potential dryness. Consider a renewal retreat or extended time in the Word and worship."

## Relationship to Spiritual Maturity Trajectory

* **Spiritual Health Index** is a *present-tense snapshot*, assessing how spiritually "nourished" and balanced a user currently is.
* **Spiritual Maturity Trajectory** (to be documented next) will be a *longitudinal, growth-oriented model*, tracing how a user has progressed (or regressed) over time through distinct stages of sanctification, transformation, and equipping.

They are **not mutually exclusive**. Rather, they **complement each other**:

* A user may be spiritually mature (long-term growth) but in a season of spiritual dryness (low spiritual health).
* Or a user may have high vitality right now (strong health), but be early in their faith journey (immature trajectory).

Both are needed for a full picture of current spiritual formation and future direction.
