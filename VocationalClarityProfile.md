# Module: Vocational Clarity Profile

## Purpose

The **Vocational Clarity Profile** is an **inferred composite module** that synthesizes a wide range of data points to help identify an individual’s readiness and alignment for vocational direction. It does not ask direct questions but instead integrates inputs from across the PsycheGenesis assessment to surface calling clarity, strength of vocational convictions, and internal alignment between design and direction.

This module helps users answer questions like:

* "Do I know the kind of work or mission I’m called to pursue?"
* "Is my current path in alignment with how God designed me?"

## Areas Profiled

* Calling conviction and directionality
* Confidence in purpose and design
* Alignment between personality, gifting, values, and vocational role
* Resistance or avoidance patterns (e.g., fear, indecision, false humility)

## Question Structure

This module does **not** include direct questions. All inputs are derived from responses in other modules and assessment behaviors.

## Inputs (Inferred From Other Modules)

* **Motivational Gifts**: reveals natural tendencies and foundational design.
* **Spiritual Gifts (Holy Spirit)**: surfaces areas of divine empowerment.
* **Fivefold Ministry Gifts**: offers clarity on spiritual roles and leadership callings.
* **Personality Type**: cognitive and behavioral tendencies that influence work style.
* **Job Preference Profile**: preferred types of work and environments.
* **Heart Burden & Calling**: passion-driven direction and burden clarity.
* **Sanctification & Spiritual Growth**: maturity level related to obedience in calling.
* **Leadership Readiness**: inferred indicators of maturity, humility, and service.
* **Trauma History & Healing**: areas where unresolved fear or hurt may hinder clarity or boldness.

## Composite Scoring Logic

Vocational clarity is assessed across several converging vectors:

* 🎯 **Directional Clarity** (Calling + Gifts + Heart Burden alignment)
* 🧭 **Identity Alignment** (Vocational role matches personality and design)
* 🌱 **Readiness & Maturity** (Obedience to calling, not just awareness)
* 🪨 **Barriers to Clarity** (Fear, trauma, false humility, inner vows)

Each factor contributes to a composite score tier:

* **Strongly Aligned**: Clear sense of vocational purpose, integrated identity and calling.
* **Emerging Clarity**: Recognizing calling but not fully aligned in action or confidence.
* **Obscured**: Low clarity or confidence, likely due to fear, confusion, or identity disruption.

## Output & Insights Generated

* 🧩 Narrative synthesis of vocational direction and purpose design.
* 🔍 Identified alignment between personality, gifting, and mission.
* 🚧 Barriers or hesitations blocking clarity.
* 🔥 Scriptural encouragement and calling affirmations.
* 🎯 Next steps for vocational discernment or confirmation.
