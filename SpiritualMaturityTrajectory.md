# Module: Spiritual Maturity Trajectory

## Purpose

The **Spiritual Maturity Trajectory** module is designed to infer and visualize a user’s long-term sanctification journey, identifying patterns of growth, stagnation, revival, and transformation over time. It offers a narrative-informed and biblically grounded perspective on the believer’s ongoing formation into Christlikeness.

## Areas Profiled

* Past growth milestones and setbacks
* Breakthroughs, plateaus, and renewal cycles
* Historical fruit of the Spirit development
* Persistence through trials and testing
* Historical patterns of obedience, repentance, and faith
* Influence of spiritual mentors, community, and discipline

## Question Structure

* No direct questionnaire
* Inferred through cross-analysis of:

  * Timeline & Spiritual Milestones module
  * Healing History & Restoration module
  * Sanctification & Growth Stage assessment
  * Narrative synthesis inputs
  * Leadership readiness indicators
  * Journaled turning points (if included)

## Output

* Visual maturity arc (timeline chart or narrative diagram)
* Categorization into trajectory types (e.g., Steady Climber, Late Bloomer, Flame Then Fizzle, Long Obedience, Healing-Centered Growth)
* Flags for potential spiritual plateaus or breakthrough readiness

## Insights Generated

* Offers encouragement or exhortation based on past growth and patterns
* Helps pastoral mentors or counselors understand a person’s spiritual development history
