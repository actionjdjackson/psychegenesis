# PsycheGenesis System Overview

Created by Jacob Jackson, **PsycheGenesis** is a multidimensional assessment and profiling framework crafted to map the entire human experience—spirit, soul, and body—within a biblically anchored, psychologically insightful, and scientifically informed model. It is designed to offer an integrated lens through which individuals can better grasp their unique God-given identity, spiritual development, and holistic life design. By merging theology, psychology, somatic understanding, and vocational alignment, PsycheGenesis equips users to thrive across emotional, spiritual, and practical domains.

## Purpose

PsycheGenesis serves as a Spirit-led tool for personal transformation by helping users:

* Uncover their spiritual gifts, personality patterns, temperament, and calling.
* Reflect deeply on their journey of sanctification, healing, and soul restoration.
* Understand the shaping influence of genetics, temperament, trauma, upbringing, and spiritual milestones.
* Connect emotional and somatic awareness with spiritual development and behavioral change.
* Integrate biblical discipleship with neuroscience, identity theory, and growth psychology into a redemptive understanding of the human self.
* Align vocational pathways and spiritual callings to how a person is uniquely wired in both divine gifting and natural temperament.
* Recognize potential leadership readiness based on biblical maturity, not merely charisma or outward qualifications.

## Key Features

* 🔍 **Integrated Assessment Engine**: All modules feed into a unified profile with randomized question delivery, adaptive scoring, milestone triggers, and trauma-aware pacing logic.
* 🧠 **Mind-Gut-Heart Axis**: Captures embodied emotional experience, intuitive knowing, and neuro-emotional processing across the primary centers of internal awareness.
* 🕊️ **Spiritual Timeline Builder**: Enables users to map key spiritual events such as salvation, water and Spirit baptism, moments of calling, breakthrough, inner healing, and spiritual gift activation.
* 💡 **Role Recommendations**: Suggests biblically grounded roles, ministries, and vocations based on sanctification stage, character, temperament, relational maturity, gifting profile, and leadership development.
* 🔥 **Healing & Restoration Insights**: Tracks trauma exposure, inner vows, body memory, emotional regulation issues, and healing recovery pathways—offering grace-filled reflection and redemptive re-narration.
* 🧩 **Composite Profile System**: Normalizes and integrates insights across multiple assessment streams, offering a coherent, Spirit-led, and psychologically grounded story of the whole person.
* ✅ **Leadership Readiness Flags**: Automatically evaluate readiness for spiritual leadership roles (e.g., pastor, elder, missionary, mentor) based on maturity indicators drawn from sanctification stage, trauma healing status, relationship health, biblical qualifications (1 Tim 3, Titus 1), emotional regulation, and gift activation. Flags can recommend waiting, preparation, or confirmation by spiritual authority.
* ⚙️ **Role Recommendation Engine**: Calculates best-fit callings, life roles, or ministries by integrating all module outputs using weighted composite logic. It balances maturity, temperament, gifting, and healing to suggest personalized pathways forward.
* 📖 **Narrative Synthesis Generator**: Produces a personalized, redemptive life narrative that weaves together a user’s spiritual journey, gifting, personality, sanctification stage, trauma recovery, and divine calling. The result is a reflective, hope-filled story that contextualizes how God has shaped and is shaping the user’s life purpose.
* ⚠️ **Blind Spots & Cautions**: Designed to illuminate areas of potential imbalance, overextension, or hidden vulnerability that may not be evident through strengths-based assessments alone. It provides a redemptive lens to interpret common patterns such as over-empathy, perfectionism, impulsiveness, or avoidance, and supports growth by surfacing these traits gently and biblically.
* 🖥️ **User Interface & Experience Flow**:

  * **Likert Scale Questions**: Presented as a row of circles sized from large to small to large, colored from red (big, leftmost) to gray (small, center) to green (big, rightmost). Red = “not like me at all,” gray = “neutral,” green = “totally like me.”
  * **Yes/No Questions**: Displayed as neutral Y and N radio-button options with no color or symbol bias to avoid influencing response valence, especially for trauma- or vulnerability-related questions.
  * **Question Pagination**: Assessment flows in randomized order, 5–10 questions per page. Trauma and healing-related questions appear at the end in an intentional progression from surface-level to deeper reflection.
  * **Timeline Builder**: Isolated on its own page with flexible placement (beginning, midpoint, or end) depending on assessment flow configuration. Midpoint is often optimal to provide narrative context without overwhelming users upfront.
* 📊 **Administrative & Counselor Dashboard**: Enables authorized facilitators, coaches, or pastoral counselors to:

  * View user profiles, scores, growth stage summaries, and redemptive narratives.
  * Filter and tag users by spiritual maturity, leadership readiness, trauma recovery stage, or gifting category.
  * Export anonymized data for aggregate insights, program tailoring, or church ministry planning.
  * Set follow-up actions or notes for discipleship, mentorship, or spiritual formation.
  * Grant or restrict module access depending on user role (e.g., pastoral vs. layperson).

# Module: Blindspots & Cautions

## Purpose

The Blindspots & Cautions module is designed to illuminate areas of potential imbalance, overextension, or hidden vulnerability that may not be evident through strengths-based assessments alone. It provides a redemptive lens to interpret common patterns such as over-empathy, perfectionism, impulsiveness, or avoidance, and supports growth by surfacing these traits gently and biblically.

## Areas Profiled

* Emotional overextension (e.g. over-empathy, people-pleasing)
* Behavioral patterns (e.g. impulsivity, over-control)
* Internal pressure points (e.g. perfectionism, shame-driven motivation)
* Gift distortions (e.g. mercy without truth, leadership without humility)
* Spiritual maturity imbalances (e.g. high zeal, low root depth)
* Unbalanced identity traits (e.g. idealism without grounding)
* Repetitive pain cycles (often linked to trauma, unmet needs, or inner vows)

## Question Structure

* **Derived Patterns**: No direct questionnaire. Blindspots are inferred through cross-metric analysis.
* **Triggering Indicators**:

  * Strengths without balancing traits (e.g. high compassion, low assertiveness)
  * Trait clusters that signal risk (e.g. prophet + anxious attachment + high somatic tension)
  * Spiritual gift activity that outpaces maturity or healing
  * Trauma patterns influencing leadership drives or role aspirations

## Output

* **Watchpoints Section**: A dedicated portion of the final profile summary highlighting potential blindspots or cautionary patterns.
* **Narrative Synthesis Highlights**: Integrated into the personalized life narrative as grace-filled insights for discipleship and spiritual growth.
* **Administrative View**: Caution flags visible to counselors, coaches, or mentors to support redemptive conversations.

## Insights Generated

Each blindspot is framed with affirmation, clarity, and an invitation to growth:

* **Over-Empathy**: "Your gift of mercy is a blessing. To sustain your calling, the Lord may be inviting you into stronger boundaries and Spirit-led discernment."

* **Perfectionism**: "You carry high standards that reflect God's excellence. But He may be calling you to embrace grace in progress, not just outcomes."

* **Impulsiveness**: "Your boldness is a strength. Slowing down for spiritual discernment may help you avoid unnecessary detours."

* **Avoidant Tendencies**: "Your desire for peace is good. But God may be drawing you into deeper healing where fear has held you back."

* **Over-Identification with Role or Gift**: "Your calling is powerful, but your identity is first as a child of God—not your ministry function."

This module supports transformation not by shaming, but by shining light in love—encouraging repentance, healing, and wise stewardship of one’s wiring and walk.

# Module: Calling Readiness (Inferred)

## Purpose

To assess whether a user is currently ready to step into their divine calling, ministry assignment, or vocational purpose. This module does not rely on direct questioning but is inferred through integrated analysis of spiritual maturity, emotional healing, and gifting activation.

## Areas Profiled

* Sanctification & Spiritual Growth Stage
* Trauma History & Healing Progress
* Fivefold Ministry Gift Activation
* Heart Burden / Calling Priorities
* Leadership Readiness Flags
* Timeline & Spiritual Milestones

## Question Structure

*Inferred module — no direct question set.* Instead, it draws from:

* Questionnaire outputs across spiritual gifts, growth, and leadership indicators
* Timeline entries related to calling, surrender, and prophetic confirmations
* Healing history and current restoration status

## Output

* Readiness Tier: **"Future Calling / Preparation Mode," "Emerging Calling / Transitional Season," or "Active Calling / Confirmation Stage"**
* Barriers to Readiness: Highlights key blockers such as unhealed trauma, relationship immaturity, spiritual dryness, or undeveloped fruit of the Spirit
* Acceleration Paths: Suggestions for mentoring, discipleship, healing, or confirmation practices to help align the user with God’s timing

## Insights Generated

* "You carry a strong teaching and pastoral gifting, but your sanctification profile suggests this is a season of preparation and inner healing rather than immediate leadership."
* "Based on your gifting activation, timeline entries, and confirmed leadership traits, you may be in a season of vocational emergence. Seek confirmation through trusted mentors."
* "You’ve experienced a divine calling moment and have matured significantly. Your readiness profile indicates you’re prepared to walk in that calling with humility and faith."

This module feeds into the **Leadership Readiness Flags** and **Role Recommendation Engine**, ensuring no premature recommendations are made for users who are not spiritually or emotionally prepared for high-stakes roles.

# Module: Identity Wholeness Score

## Purpose

The Identity Wholeness Score is an **inferred composite metric** designed to reflect a user’s core sense of self, resilience, and integration of past wounds with present truth. It helps surface whether the user operates from their **God-given identity** or from an adaptive/false self shaped by trauma, fear, or societal expectation.

It is not a directly assessed module. Instead, it draws input from multiple assessed modules to estimate a person’s **identity cohesion, authenticity, and narrative integrity.**

## Inputs (Inferred From Assessed Modules)

* **Sanctification & Spiritual Growth**: maturity, spiritual rootedness, fruit of the Spirit.
* **Healing History & Inner Vows**: resolution of shame, self-perception, false identity patterns.
* **Relationship & Attachment Style**: emotional congruence, boundary clarity, secure base.
* **Calling Readiness** *(inferred)*: conviction, value consistency, non-performance identity.
* **Trauma Recovery & Somatic Awareness**: ability to differentiate true self from adaptive self.

## Realigned Question Mapping (From Other Modules)

These identity-based insights are gathered from other modules, where the questions are assessed:

| Statement                                                                | Assessed Module                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| “I feel like I know who I truly am even when circumstances change.”      | Sanctification & Spiritual Growth      |
| “I can speak honestly about my failures without shame.”                  | Healing History & Restoration Pathways |
| “My values stay consistent regardless of the group I’m with.”            | Sanctification & Spiritual Growth      |
| “I no longer feel the need to pretend or prove myself to others.”        | Trauma Recovery / Inner Vows           |
| “I feel like the same person whether I’m alone or in public.”            | Relationship & Attachment Style        |
| “I know the difference between my true self and my trauma-adapted self.” | Trauma Recovery / Healing History      |

## Composite Scoring Logic

The Identity Wholeness Score uses a **weighted composite system**, balancing the following dimensions:

* ✅ Authenticity & Non-Performance Identity (Calling + Attachment)
* ✅ Shame Resolution & Emotional Transparency (Healing + Relationship)
* ✅ Consistent Moral Compass & Conviction (Sanctification + Heart Burden)
* ✅ Differentiation of True vs. False Self (Healing + Somatic Awareness)
* ✅ Resilience & Continuity Under Pressure (Sanctification + Timeline)

**Scoring Tiers:**

* **Integrated (80–100%)**: High authenticity, spiritual and emotional coherence, healthy vulnerability.
* **Emerging (60–79%)**: Progressing in self-understanding, with some areas of masking or disconnection.
* **Fragmented (0–59%)**: Significant masking, unresolved wounds, or identity defined by external factors.

## Insights Generated

* 💡 Narrative summary of the user’s identity development journey.
* 🪞 Highlighted themes of growth, stability, and integration.
* ⚠️ Identity cautions such as perfectionism, codependency, or shape-shifting for approval.

# Module: Spiritual Health Index (Inferred)

## Purpose

To provide a snapshot-style, cross-dimensional indicator of the user’s overall spiritual well-being, vitality, and alignment with biblical rhythms of life. The Spiritual Health Index is like a real-time pulse check on the soul’s nourishment, alertness, and submission to the Holy Spirit, derived from multiple other inputs across the PsycheGenesis system.

## Areas Profiled

* Timeline Recency of Key Events (e.g. recent revival, baptism, repentance, guidance received)
* Frequency and Impact of Healing Milestones
* Emotional Regulation Scores
* Relationship and Attachment Style Health
* Fruit of the Spirit Development (inferred from growth, relational, and trauma/healing metrics)
* Somatic Awareness and Restorative Rhythms
* Worship, Prayer, and Discipleship-Related Timeline Entries

## Question Structure

*Inferred module — no dedicated question set.* Derived from:

* Response patterns across sanctification, healing, and somatic/emotional modules
* Recency of spiritual activity and timeline confirmations
* Balance between output (ministry, calling) and input (nourishment, rest, worship)

## Output

* Indexed Score: **"Low," "Developing," "Moderate," "Strong," or "Flourishing"**
* Highlighted Deficiencies: e.g. emotional fatigue, spiritual dryness, disconnection from community, lack of input rhythms
* Strength Indicators: e.g. consistent prayer life, healing integration, spiritual renewal markers
* Recommendations: re-engage in spiritual disciplines, seek prayer/ministry, prioritize spiritual rest, etc.

## Insights Generated

* "You are flourishing in many areas of spiritual vitality, especially in relational depth and prophetic awareness, though your rest rhythms may be lagging."
* "Your score suggests a developing stage, with recent healing breakthroughs but signs of spiritual fatigue. Now is a good time to rest and be poured into."
* "Low input rhythms and a long gap since your last major milestone suggest potential dryness. Consider a renewal retreat or extended time in the Word and worship."

---

## Relationship to Spiritual Maturity Trajectory

* **Spiritual Health Index** is a *present-tense snapshot*, assessing how spiritually "nourished" and balanced a user currently is.
* **Spiritual Maturity Trajectory** (to be documented next) will be a *longitudinal, growth-oriented model*, tracing how a user has progressed (or regressed) over time through distinct stages of sanctification, transformation, and equipping.

They are **not mutually exclusive**. Rather, they **complement each other**:

* A user may be spiritually mature (long-term growth) but in a season of spiritual dryness (low spiritual health).
* Or a user may have high vitality right now (strong health), but be early in their faith journey (immature trajectory).

Both are needed for a full picture of current spiritual formation and future direction.

# Module: Vocational Clarity Profile

## Purpose

The **Vocational Clarity Profile** is an **inferred composite module** that synthesizes a wide range of data points to help identify an individual’s readiness and alignment for vocational direction. It does not ask direct questions but instead integrates inputs from across the PsycheGenesis assessment to surface calling clarity, strength of vocational convictions, and internal alignment between design and direction.

This module helps users answer questions like:

* "Do I know the kind of work or mission I’m called to pursue?"
* "Is my current path in alignment with how God designed me?"

## Areas Profiled

* Calling conviction and directionality
* Confidence in purpose and design
* Alignment between personality, gifting, values, and vocational role

## Composite Scoring Logic

Vocational clarity is assessed across several converging vectors:

* 🎯 **Directional Clarity** (Calling + Gifts + Heart Burden alignment)
* 🧭 **Identity Alignment** (Vocational role matches personality and design)
* 🌱 **Readiness & Maturity** (Obedience to calling, not just awareness)
* 🪨 **Barriers to Clarity** (Fear, trauma, false humility, inner vows)

Each factor contributes to a composite score tier:

* **Strongly Aligned**: Clear sense of vocational purpose, integrated identity and calling.
* **Emerging Clarity**: Recognizing calling but not fully aligned in action or confidence.
* **Obscured**: Low clarity or confidence, likely due to fear, confusion, or identity disruption.

## Output & Insights Generated

# Module: False Self Detection

## Purpose

The **False Self Detection** module identifies the degree to which a user may be operating from a distorted or adaptive identity—a "false self" developed through trauma, unmet needs, societal roles, or spiritual confusion. This module exists to support the user's healing journey and spiritual formation by revealing where performance, pretending, or self-erasure may be hindering full alignment with their God-given identity.

This module is **entirely inferred**, not directly assessed through standalone questions, but derived from patterns across other modules.

## Areas Profiled

This module gathers insight from:

* **Trauma & Inner Vows** (self-protective adaptations, shame-based beliefs)
* **Healing History & Restoration** (emotional fragmentation, wounded identity)
* **Somatic Awareness** (body disconnect, tension masking truth)
* **Identity Wholeness Score** (authenticity vs. fragmentation)
* **Calling Readiness** (performance-based conviction vs. genuine calling)
* **Relationship & Attachment Style** (masking to please or withdraw)
* **Sanctification & Growth** (legalism, false humility, religious masking)

## Key Patterns Detected

* People-pleasing and shapeshifting for acceptance
* Emotional masking or over-compensation
* Hyper-religious identity performance
* Disconnection from true feelings or desires
* Identity dependent on roles or outcomes

## Composite Scoring Logic

The False Self Detection module uses:

* 🌪️ **Masking Index**: Discrepancy between public roles and internal congruence
* 🔍 **Authenticity Divergence Score**: Indicators of inner conflict, suppression, or self-denial
* 🩹 **Wounded Identity Modifier**: Based on unresolved trauma or strong inner vows
* 💡 **Integration Index**: From overlap with Identity Wholeness and Somatic Awareness

## Scoring Tiers

| Tier                       | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Authentic Self-Led**     | High congruence, low masking, living transparently from true identity    |
| **Emerging Authenticity**  | Awareness growing, but some false-self behaviors remain                  |
| **Adaptive Self Dominant** | Operates primarily from adaptive identity with notable disconnection     |
| **Performance-Driven**     | High masking, spiritualized identity, vulnerable to burnout or confusion |

## Insights Generated

* 🧩 False-self identity maps and behavior patterns
* 🛠️ Personalized healing steps to dismantle false roles and masks
* 💬 Narrative contrast: "Who I’ve had to be" vs. "Who I truly am in Christ"
* ⚠️ Cautions for identity-based burnout or people-pleasing traps
* 📖 Scriptures: Romans 12:2, Colossians 3:9–10, Galatians 2:20, Psalm 51:6

This module works synergistically with **Identity Wholeness**, **Healing History**, and **Calling Readiness**, and may influence role suitability and discipleship next steps.
