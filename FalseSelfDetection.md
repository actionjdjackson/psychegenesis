# Module: False Self Detection

## Purpose

The **False Self Detection** module identifies the degree to which a user may be operating from a distorted or adaptive identity—a "false self" developed through trauma, unmet needs, societal roles, or spiritual confusion. This module exists to support the user's healing journey and spiritual formation by revealing where performance, pretending, or self-erasure may be hindering full alignment with their God-given identity.

This module is **entirely inferred**, not directly assessed through standalone questions, but derived from patterns across other modules.

## Areas Profiled

This module gathers insight from:

* **Trauma & Inner Vows** (self-protective adaptations, shame-based beliefs)
* **Healing History & Restoration** (emotional fragmentation, wounded identity)
* **Somatic Awareness** (body disconnect, tension masking truth)
* **Identity Wholeness Score** (authenticity vs. fragmentation)
* **Calling Readiness** (performance-based conviction vs. genuine calling)
* **Relationship & Attachment Style** (masking to please or withdraw)
* **Sanctification & Growth** (legalism, false humility, religious masking)

## Key Patterns Detected

* People-pleasing and shapeshifting for acceptance
* Emotional masking or over-compensation
* Hyper-religious identity performance
* Disconnection from true feelings or desires
* Identity dependent on roles or outcomes

## Composite Scoring Logic

The False Self Detection module uses:

* 🌪️ **Masking Index**: Discrepancy between public roles and internal congruence
* 🔍 **Authenticity Divergence Score**: Indicators of inner conflict, suppression, or self-denial
* 🩹 **Wounded Identity Modifier**: Based on unresolved trauma or strong inner vows
* 💡 **Integration Index**: From overlap with Identity Wholeness and Somatic Awareness

## Scoring Tiers

| Tier                       | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Authentic Self-Led**     | High congruence, low masking, living transparently from true identity    |
| **Emerging Authenticity**  | Awareness growing, but some false-self behaviors remain                  |
| **Adaptive Self Dominant** | Operates primarily from adaptive identity with notable disconnection     |
| **Performance-Driven**     | High masking, spiritualized identity, vulnerable to burnout or confusion |

## Insights Generated

* 🧩 False-self identity maps and behavior patterns
* 🛠️ Personalized healing steps to dismantle false roles and masks
* 💬 Narrative contrast: "Who I’ve had to be" vs. "Who I truly am in Christ"
* ⚠️ Cautions for identity-based burnout or people-pleasing traps
* 📖 Scriptures: Romans 12:2, Colossians 3:9–10, Galatians 2:20, Psalm 51:6

This module works synergistically with **Identity Wholeness**, **Healing History**, and **Calling Readiness**, and may influence role suitability and discipleship next steps.
