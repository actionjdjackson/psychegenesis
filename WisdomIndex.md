# Module: Wisdom Index

## Purpose

The **Wisdom Index** is an **inferred module** designed to assess a user’s ability to apply knowledge, discernment, and spiritual insight in life decisions. Unlike intelligence (IQ) or emotional awareness (EQ), **wisdom reflects maturity in action**—the capacity to make right choices, weigh consequences, and live in alignment with both divine truth and practical reality.

This index is not derived from a direct set of questions, but from how a person integrates truth, timing, empathy, and prudence across all areas of life.
