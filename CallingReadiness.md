# Module: Calling Readiness (Inferred)

## Purpose

To assess whether a user is currently ready to step into their divine calling, ministry assignment, or vocational purpose. This module does not rely on direct questioning but is inferred through integrated analysis of spiritual maturity, emotional healing, and gifting activation.

## Areas Profiled

* Sanctification & Spiritual Growth Stage
* Trauma History & Healing Progress
* Fivefold Ministry Gift Activation
* Heart Burden / Calling Priorities
* Leadership Readiness Flags
* Timeline & Spiritual Milestones

## Question Structure

*Inferred module — no direct question set.* Instead, it draws from:

* Questionnaire outputs across spiritual gifts, growth, and leadership indicators
* Timeline entries related to calling, surrender, and prophetic confirmations
* Healing history and current restoration status

## Output

* Readiness Tier: **"Future Calling / Preparation Mode," "Emerging Calling / Transitional Season," or "Active Calling / Confirmation Stage"**
* Barriers to Readiness: Highlights key blockers such as unhealed trauma, relationship immaturity, spiritual dryness, or undeveloped fruit of the Spirit
* Acceleration Paths: Suggestions for mentoring, discipleship, healing, or confirmation practices to help align the user with God’s timing

## Insights Generated

* "You carry a strong teaching and pastoral gifting, but your sanctification profile suggests this is a season of preparation and inner healing rather than immediate leadership."
* "Based on your gifting activation, timeline entries, and confirmed leadership traits, you may be in a season of vocational emergence. Seek confirmation through trusted mentors."
* "You’ve experienced a divine calling moment and have matured significantly. Your readiness profile indicates you’re prepared to walk in that calling with humility and faith."

This module feeds into the **Leadership Readiness Flags** and **Role Recommendation Engine**, ensuring no premature recommendations are made for users who are not spiritually or emotionally prepared for high-stakes roles.
