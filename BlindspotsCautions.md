# Module: Blindspots & Cautions

## Purpose

The Blindspots & Cautions module is designed to illuminate areas of potential imbalance, overextension, or hidden vulnerability that may not be evident through strengths-based assessments alone. It provides a redemptive lens to interpret common patterns such as over-empathy, perfectionism, impulsiveness, or avoidance, and supports growth by surfacing these traits gently and biblically.

## Areas Profiled

* Emotional overextension (e.g. over-empathy, people-pleasing)
* Behavioral patterns (e.g. impulsivity, over-control)
* Internal pressure points (e.g. perfectionism, shame-driven motivation)
* Gift distortions (e.g. mercy without truth, leadership without humility)
* Spiritual maturity imbalances (e.g. high zeal, low root depth)
* Unbalanced identity traits (e.g. idealism without grounding)
* Repetitive pain cycles (often linked to trauma, unmet needs, or inner vows)

## Question Structure

* **Derived Patterns**: No direct questionnaire. Blindspots are inferred through cross-metric analysis.
* **Triggering Indicators**:

  * Strengths without balancing traits (e.g. high compassion, low assertiveness)
  * Trait clusters that signal risk (e.g. prophet + anxious attachment + high somatic tension)
  * Spiritual gift activity that outpaces maturity or healing
  * Trauma patterns influencing leadership drives or role aspirations

## Output

* **Watchpoints Section**: A dedicated portion of the final profile summary highlighting potential blindspots or cautionary patterns.
* **Narrative Synthesis Highlights**: Integrated into the personalized life narrative as grace-filled insights for discipleship and spiritual growth.
* **Administrative View**: Caution flags visible to counselors, coaches, or mentors to support redemptive conversations.

## Insights Generated

Each blindspot is framed with affirmation, clarity, and an invitation to growth:

* **Over-Empathy**: "Your gift of mercy is a blessing. To sustain your calling, the Lord may be inviting you into stronger boundaries and Spirit-led discernment."

* **Perfectionism**: "You carry high standards that reflect God's excellence. But He may be calling you to embrace grace in progress, not just outcomes."

* **Impulsiveness**: "Your boldness is a strength. Slowing down for spiritual discernment may help you avoid unnecessary detours."

* **Avoidant Tendencies**: "Your desire for peace is good. But God may be drawing you into deeper healing where fear has held you back."

* **Over-Identification with Role or Gift**: "Your calling is powerful, but your identity is first as a child of God—not your ministry function."

This module supports transformation not by shaming, but by shining light in love—encouraging repentance, healing, and wise stewardship of one’s wiring and walk.
