# Module: Character & Gifting Alignment Index

## Purpose

The **Character & Gifting Alignment Index** evaluates the relationship between a user’s **spiritual maturity (fruit)** and **spiritual giftedness (function)**. It determines whether a person’s **influence is safely grounded in godly character**, or whether their gifting outpaces their maturity—highlighting risks and discipleship needs. This module helps ensure that individuals steward their gifts **with wisdom, humility, and spiritual integrity**.

## Areas Profiled

* Spiritual Fruit Maturity (Galatians 5:22–23)
* Spiritual Gifts (power, revelatory, and motivational)
* Fivefold Ministry Callings
* Sanctification & Growth Stage
* Healing History, Inner Vows, and Trauma Recovery

## Question Structure

This module is **inferred**, not directly assessed. It draws composite insights from:

* Fruit maturity indicators (from Sanctification & Spiritual Growth)
* Gifting strength and influence level (from Spiritual Gifts and Fivefold Modules)
* Signs of unresolved wounds or adaptive behavior (from Healing History and Inner Vows)

## Composite Scoring Logic

The scoring algorithm cross-references:

* **Gift Intensity Score**: Based on strength, breadth, and leadership implications of spiritual gifts.
* **Fruit Maturity Score**: Aggregated from sanctification metrics and fruit-aligned behaviors.
* **Character Gap Score**: Difference between Gift and Fruit scores.
* **Healing Alignment Modifier**: Adjusts based on unhealed trauma or unresolved inner vows.
