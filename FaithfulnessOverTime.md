# Module: Faithfulness Over Time

## Purpose

The **Faithfulness Over Time** module is an **inferred composite indicator** that estimates a user’s consistency in living out their beliefs, spiritual disciplines, values, and commitments over the long term. Rather than measuring one-time highs or emotional intensity, this module highlights sustained obedience, covenant-keeping, endurance under trial, and long-haul integrity.

This module supports maturity tracking and helps determine whether someone’s spiritual walk is **growing deeper** or plateauing, and whether they are capable of **entrusted leadership** or mentorship roles.
